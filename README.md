This is an example Wiki built with Persevere 2.0. It is recommended that you 
install this package with NPM, so that
all dependencies will be automatically resolved:

	mkdir node_modules
	cd node_modules
    npm install persevere-example-wiki

And then go into the installed package directory and run the index.js to start the wiki:

    cd persevere-example-wiki
    node index.js

See [the Persevere installation instructions](http://persvr.org/Page/Installation) for
more information on installation or installing on RingoJS.
